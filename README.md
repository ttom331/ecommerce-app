Features Implemented

Basket for guest users only currently.
- Users are able to add, remove and adjust the quantity of items in the basket.
- Some products have different colors and each color has different stock. This was successfull by creating a color and a color_product table. Relationships were created in the model to allow products with different colors to have different stocks. Stock without colors just have their own stock attribute. 
- First time using ajax request for changing the quantity, doesn't require page reload. Basket is still being worked on.
- Integrated Stripe API for adding checkout for guest users only currently. Users can purchase the orders with stripe api integration and use webhooks events (checkout.session.completed) to store orders to database.
- Had to create 3 new Order tables and their relationships. (orders, order_addresses and order_items)

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
